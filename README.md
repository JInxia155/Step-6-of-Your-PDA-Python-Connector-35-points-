Step 6 of Your PDA Python/Connector (35 points)

For this part you need to download and install Connector/Python.

You are to create an application using Python/Connector that makes sense for your PDA. Your application must have multiple SQL commands and user input that allows you to complete a “higher-level” problem. Submit a

.pdf file that includes: (1) a description (in English) of what your application does, (2) your Python/SQL code, and (3) output of the execution of your code that demonstrates that it works.
